# Development Session

Please continue development on my Phaser.js game project in a two-phase approach for maximum token efficiency.

## Phase 1 - Planning:
1. Review only these key documentation files:
   - API_REFERENCE.md
   - TODO.md
   - CHANGELOG.md

2. Identify the highest priority task from TODO.md (or my specific request if provided)

3. List exactly which source files need to be examined to implement this task
   - Be specific (e.g., "js/scenes/GameScene.js" not just "scene files")
   - Explain briefly why each file is needed

4. Wait for me to provide these specific files before proceeding to Phase 2

## Phase 2 - Implementation:
1. Implement EXACTLY ONE task based on the files provided
   - Ensure it results in a stable, working build
   - Follow all guidelines in CODING_GUIDELINES.md
   - Utilize appropriate Phaser.js features and best practices

2. Maintain all project standards:
   - Follow Phaser's scene-based architecture
   - Use Phaser's built-in systems (physics, input, animation)
   - Keep code and data separate (JSON files in data/ directory)
   - Document schemas for any new data types

3. Update all documentation comprehensively:
   - Update API_REFERENCE.md with new/modified interfaces
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with changes from this session only
   - Update TODO.md to mark completed tasks and add new ones
   - Update other documentation as needed

4. Provide complete file content for any changed or new files
   - Always include the entire file, ready for copy-paste

## Response Format for Phase 1:
1. Identified task to implement
2. List of specific files needed with brief explanation

## Response Format for Phase 2:
1. Summary of implementation
2. Complete content of all changed/new files
3. Updates to API_REFERENCE.md and other documentation
4. Next recommended task(s)

After completing Phase 2, I will start a new conversation for the next development session.
